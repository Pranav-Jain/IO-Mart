# IO-Mart
One of the few problems faced by the common people in
their day-to-day lives is standing in long checkout queues
for shopping and waiting for billing of each item. The
recent demonetization only added to the madness
where people couldn't buy daily groceries. This project
aims to solve this critical problem.
